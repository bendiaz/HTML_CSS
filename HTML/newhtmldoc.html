<h5>Enigern</h5>
<p>Slowly and deliberately, Enigern approached the mighty dragon. A rustle in the trees of the nearby forest distracted his attention for a brief moment, a near fatal mistake for the brave knight
</p>
<p>The dragon lunged at him, searing Enigern's armor with a rapid blast of fiery breath. Enigern fell to the ground as the dragon hovered over him. He quickly drew his sword and thrust it into the dragon's chest
</p>
<p>The dragon fell to the ground, releasing an anguished cry and seething in pain. The thrust of Enigern's sword proved fatal as the dragon breathed its last breath. Now Enigern was free to release Lady Aellfeda from her imprisonment in the dragon's lair.</p>
<p> How she got there? No fuckin' clue</p>

    <h1> Really Honest Book Reviews</h1>
    <p>I read a lot of books about many different subjects. Though I'm not a book critic, and I don't do this for a living, I enjoy a really good read every now and then. Here's a list of books that I've read recently:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="rainbow.html"><em>The Rainbow Returns</em> by E. Smith</a> A fantasy story set in biblical times. Slow at times, but interesting.</li>
        <li><em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/01/billionaires-warren-buffett-bill-gates-agree-this-is-the-ultimate-test-of-how-you-have-lived-your-life.html#" >Seven Steps to Immeasurable Wealth</em> by R.U. Needy</a>
            I'm still poor, but I'm happy! And that's the whole point.
        </li>
        <li><em><a href="food.html">The Food-Lovers Guide to Weight Loss</em>by L. Goode</a>
            At last! A diet book with recipes that taste good!
        </li>
        <li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seriousness#Detecting_degree_of_seriousness_in_developmental_psychology" >The Silly Person's Guide to Seriousness</em> by M. Nott</a>
            Come on...who wants to be serious?

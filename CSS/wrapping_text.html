    <h1>Mystery Tulip Murderer Strikes</h1>
    <p style="clear: left;">
        Someone, or something, is killing the tulips of New South Haverford, Virginia. Residents of this small town are shocked and dismayed by the senseless vandalism that has struck their tiny town.

        New South Haverford is known for its extravagent displays of tulips in the springtime, and a good portion of its tourist tades relies on the people who come from as far as New Hampshire to see what has been estimated as up to town hundred thousand tulips
        that bloom in April and May.

        Or at least the tourists had been flocking to New South Haverford until least week, when over the course of three days the flower of each and every tulip in the town was neatly clipped off while the town slept.

        "It started at the south end of town," said Augustin Frouf, a retired ladder-maker who has personally planted over five hundred pink lily=flowered tulips. "They hit the houses up on Elm street, and moved down into town from there. After the second night,
        we tried keeping guard. We tried bright lights, dogs, everything. There was always something that pulled us away, and by the time we got back, They were all gone."
